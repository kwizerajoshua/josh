System for Managing Employee Records, Departments, and Projects

In a modern organizational context, effective management of employee records, departmental structures, and associated projects is crucial. This database management system is designed to handle the complexities of human resources by storing detailed information about employees,including their roles, salaries, and project assignments, their respective departments, and the projects they are working on. The system aims to enhance operational efficiency, facilitate reporting, and ensure clear visibility into workforce management.

These commands create three tables: departments, employees, and projects. Each table is designed with relevant fields, and foreign key relationships are established to maintain data integrity.
